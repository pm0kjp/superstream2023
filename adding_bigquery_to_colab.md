# Adding BigQuery Functionality to a Colab notebook

Aside: Not sure what a Colab notebook is?  If you've ever used a Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook, then Google's Colaboratory (Colab) will be a fairly easy leap.

Regardless, you'll certainly benefit from the fact that Colaboratory communicates very easily with BigQuery!

1. Click on this link to a Colaboratory (Colab) notebook, and if prompted to log in or select your account, **choose the same one** you're using for your work in BigQuery:

https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/bigquery.ipynb

This is Google's own intro to the integration between Colab and BigQuery.  

2.  Notice that there are three listed ways to integrate BigQuery with Colab.  I prefer to use the second listed method, "Use BigQuery through google-cloud-bigquery".

3.  Save a copy of this notebook by clicking on "Copy to Drive" or File > Save a copy in Drive.

4.  Use the method you prefer in a new notebook (File > New notebook) by using copy / paste.  Note that you'll also have to provide authentication into GCP.
